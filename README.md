# GovukNotifyRails

Custom ActionMailer delivery to send emails via the API client for GOV.UK Notify.

[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/govuk_notify_rails.svg)](https://badge.fury.io/rb/govuk_notify_rails)

## Installation

Prior to usage an account must be created through the [GOV.UK Notify](https://www.notifications.service.gov.uk) admin console. This will provide the API credentials needed in you application.

You can then install the gem or require it in your application.

```ruby
gem 'govuk_notify_rails'
```

Please note this gem makes use of the [notifications-ruby-client](https://github.com/alphagov/notifications-ruby-client) gem version >= 1.0.0

You can use a specific version in your Gemfile.

In your app, you will need to add the delivery method, and set the `service_id` and `secret_key`, for example with an initializer:

```ruby
ActionMailer::Base.add_delivery_method :govuk_notify, GovukNotifyRails::Delivery,
  service_id: ENV['GOVUK_NOTIFY_SERVICE_ID'],
  secret_key: ENV['GOVUK_NOTIFY_API_SECRET']
```

## Usage

To send emails through GOV.UK Notify, create your mailers like usual but inheriting from `GovukNotifyRails::Mailer`. Then just use `mail()` as with any other ActionMailer passing the recipient email.

The template ID is mandatory, but the personalisation is optional.

```ruby
class NotifyMailer < GovukNotifyRails::Mailer
  #
  # Define methods as usual, and set the template and personalisation accordingly
  #
  def my_test_email(user)
    set_template('9661d08a-486d-4c67-865e-ad976f17871d')
    
    set_personalisation(
      full_name: user.full_name,
      address: user.address
    )
    
    mail(to: user.email)
  end
end

```

### Mailer previewing

You can also create mailer previews as usual. The preview will however be a sample string as the actual template is hosted in the GOV.UK Notify website.

For example:

```ruby
class NotifyMailerPreview < ActionMailer::Preview
  
  def my_test_email
    user = User.fist
    NotifyMailer.my_test_email(user)
  end
  
end
```

With your local rails server running you can browse to ```http://localhost:3000/rails/mailers``` to view a list of current email templates
